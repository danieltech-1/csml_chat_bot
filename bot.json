This is the perfect app for a lead generation chatbot, connected to Livestorm!\n\nTo get started, you will need a Livestorm account and an API key, as described in [the Livestorm documentation](https://developers.livestorm.co/docs/authorization).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nWith this app, you can perform 3 actions:\n- get a list of your events\n- given an event ID, get a list of its sessions\n- register new participants to a session\n\nSee examples below for each available method.\n\n### List Events\n\n```cpp\ndo Fn(\n  \"livestorm\",\n  method=\"listEvents\",\n)\n```\n\n### List Event Sessions\n\n```cpp\ndo Fn(\n  \"livestorm\",\n  method=\"listEventSessions\",\n  session_id=\"SESSION_ID\"\n)\n```\n\n### Register a Participant to a Session\n\n```cpp\ndo Fn(\n  \"livestorm\",\n  method=\"registerParticipant\",\n  session_id=\"SESSION_ID\",\n  participant={\n    \"first_name\": \"John\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Doe\",\n    \"email\": \"john@doe.com\",\n    \"company\": \"CoolCompany\"\n  },\n)\n```\n\nAt least the `first_name`, `last_name` and `email` fields of the `participant` object are required. Depending on your event's configuration, some additional fields may also be required (for instance, the `company` field here), or optional. The fields can be configured from the Livestorm administration panel.\n\nIf the participant already exists, or the session is not published, or a required field is missing, or any other error as returned by Livestorm's API, this call will fail and an error message will be available in the response data.\n",
